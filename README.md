# PostErrorSlowing_JournalofNeuroscience2018

Repository with some part of the code to reproduce the data, analysis and figure of Berlemont and Nadal 2018, "Perceptual Decision-Making: Biases in Post-Error Reaction Times Explained by Attractor Network Dynamics", *Journal of Neuroscience* (https://www.jneurosci.org/content/39/5/833).

This project was the first project of my PhD thesis. Thus the source code in this repository is not really speed-optimized and lack of commentary. To have a more optimized code for a similar model, please see: https://github.com/berlemontkevin/Confidence_NeuralNetwork_ScientificReports2020

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me: kevin.berlemont@gmail.com

**src folder**

This folder contains the main code with the functions generating the numerical simulation. The file *decision-making.jl* contains the dynamical equations of the neural attractor network.
